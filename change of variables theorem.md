Let $X$ be a [[compact set|compact subset]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with [[boundary of subset|boundary]] $\partial X$ of [[n dimensional volume|volume]] $0$; let $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be an [[open set]] containing $X$. Let $\Phi:U\to\mathbb{R}^n$ be a $C^1$([[continuously differentiable function|*]]) mapping that is [[one to one|injective]] on $(X-\partial X)$ and has [[Lipschitz condition for a derivative|Lipschitz derivative]], with $[\mathbf{D}\Phi(\mathbf({x})]$ [[invertible]] at every $x\in(X-\partial X)$. Set $Y=\Phi(X)$.
Then if $f:Y\to\mathbb{R}$ is [[integral]], $(f\circ\Phi)|\det[\mathbf{D}\Phi]|$ is integrable on $X$, and $$\int_Yf(\mathbf{y})|d^m\mathbf{y}|=\int_X(f\circ\Phi)(\mathbf{x})|\det[\mathbf{D}\Phi(\mathbf{x})]||d^m\mathbf{x}|.$$
