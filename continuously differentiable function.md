A function is **continously differentiable** on $U\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ if all its [[partial derivative]]s exists and are [[continuous function|continuous]] on $U$. Such a function is known as a $C^1$ function.

A $C^p$ function on $U\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a function that is $p$ times continously differentiable: all of its partial derivatives up to order $p$ exist and are continuous on $U$.
