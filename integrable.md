A [[function]] $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ is integrable if and only if it is [[bounded]] with bounded [[support of a function|support]], and for all $\epsilon \gt 0$, there exists $N$ such that $$\overbrace{\sum_{\{C\in\mathcal{D}_N|\operatorname{osc}_C(f)\gt\epsilon\}}\operatorname{vol}_nC}^{\text{volume of all cubes for which the oscillation of } f\text{ over the cube is }\gt\epsilon}\lt\epsilon.$$
