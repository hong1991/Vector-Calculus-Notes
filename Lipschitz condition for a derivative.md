Let $U\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be [[open set|open]] and let $\mathbf{f}:U\to \mathbb{R}^m$ be a [[derivative|differentiable]] mapping. The [[derivative]] $[\mathbf{Df}(\mathbf{x})]$ satisfies a [[Lipschitz condition for a derivative|Lipschitz condition]] on a subset $V\subset U$ with [[Lipschitz condition for a derivative|Lipschitz ratio]] $M$ if for all $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in V$ $$|[\mathbf{Df}(\mathbf{x})]-[\mathbf{Df}(\mathbf{y})]|\le M|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|.$$
A function whose derivative satisfies a Lipschitz condition is certainly [[continuously differentiable]].
