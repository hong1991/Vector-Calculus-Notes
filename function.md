A **function** consists of three things: two set, called the **domain** $X$ and the **codomain** $Y$, and a rule $f:X\to Y$ that associates to any element in the domain exactly one element in the codomain.
In many case, we can get a **natural domain** from rule.
Codomain must be at least as big as the [[image]].

A **function** $f:X\to Y$ is a subset $\Gamma_f\subset X\times Y$ having the property that for every $x \in X$, there exists a unique $y\in Y$ such that $(x, y)\in \Gamma_f$.
