The **angle** between two [[points and vectors|vectors]] $\vec{\mathbf{v}}$ and $\vec{\mathbf{w}}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is that angle $\alpha$ satisfying $0\le\alpha\le\pi$ such that $$\cos\alpha=\frac{\vec{\mathbf{v}}\cdot\vec{\mathbf{w}}}{|\vec{\mathbf{v}}||\vec{\mathbf{w}}|}.$$
The [[dot product of vector|dot product]] of two vectors is positive if the angle between them is less than $\pi/2$, and negative it is bigger than $\pi/2$.
