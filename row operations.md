A **row operation** on a [[matrix]] is one of three operations:
1. Multiplying a row by a nonzero number
2. Adding a multiple of a row onto another row
3. Exchanging two rows

If the matrix $[A|\vec{\mathbf{b}}]$ representing a system of [[linear equation]]s $A\vec{\mathbf{x}}=\vec{\mathbf{b}}$ can be turned into $[A'|\vec{\mathbf{b}}']$ by a sequence of row operations, then the set of solutions of $A\vec{\mathbf{x}}=\vec{\mathbf{b}}$ and the set of solutions of $A'\vec{\mathbf{x}}=\vec{\mathbf{b}}'$ coincide.
