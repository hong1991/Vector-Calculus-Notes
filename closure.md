If $A$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, the [[closure]] of $A$, denoted $\overline{A}$, is the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that for all $r>0$ such that [[open ball]] $B_r(x)\cap A\neq \emptyset$.

The [[closure]] of a [[closed set]] is itself.
The [[closure]] of $A$ is $A$ plus its [[boundary of subset|boundary]]:$\overline{A}=A\cup\partial{A}$.
