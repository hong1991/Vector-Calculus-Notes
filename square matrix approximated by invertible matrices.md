Any square [[matrix]] $A$ can be approximated by a sequence of [[matrix inverse|invertible matrices]].
**Proof:** Set $\tilde{A}=E_k\cdots E_1A$, with $\tilde{A}$ [[triangular matrix|upper triangular]] (i.e., [[row reduction|row reduce]] $A$ until it is either the [[identity matrix|identity]] or has rows of $0$'s at the bottom). If any diagonal entries of $\tilde{A}$ are $0$, change them to $1/n$; denote the resulting [[matrix inverse|invertible matrix]] $\tilde{A}_n$. Then the matrices $$A_n:=E_1^{-1}\cdots E_k^{-1}\tilde{A}_n$$are invertible, and converge to $A$ as $n\to\infty$.
