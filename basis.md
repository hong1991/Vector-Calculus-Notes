Let $V\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a [[subspace of Rn|subspace]]. AN ordered set of vectors $\vec{\mathbf{v}}_1,...,\vec{\mathbf{v}}_k\in V$ is called a **basis** of $V$ if it satisfies any of the three equivalent conditions.
1. The set is a **maximal linear independent set**: it is [[linear independence|linearly independent]], and if you add one more vector, the set will no longer be linearly independent.
2. The set is a **minimal spanning set**: it [[span]]s $V$, and if you drop one vector, it will no longer span $V$.
3. The set is a linearly independent set spanning $V$.
