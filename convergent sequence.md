A [[sequence]] $n\mapsto a_n$ of real numbers **converges** to the [[limit of sequence|limit]] $a$ if for all $\epsilon \gt 0$, there exists $N$ such that for all $n\gt N$, we have $|a-a_n|\lt\epsilon$.

Theorem:
A nondecreasing sequence $n\mapsto a_n$ of real numbers converges if and only if it is bounded.
