If $A$ is a $n\times n$ [[matrix]], and you construct the $n\times 2n$ augmented matrix $[A|I]$ and [[row reduction|row deduce]] it, then either:
1. The first $n$ columns row reduce to the identity, in which case the last $n$ columns of the row-reduced matrix are the inverse of $A$, or
2. The first n columns do not row reduce to the identity, in which case $A$ does not have an inverse.
