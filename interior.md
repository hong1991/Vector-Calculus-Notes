If $A$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, the [[interior]] of $A$, denoted $\mathring{A}$, is the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that there exists $r>0$ such that [[open ball]] $B_r(x)\subset A$.

The [[interior]] of an [[open set]] is itself.
The [[interior]] of $A$ is $A$ minus its [[boundary of subset|boundary]]:$\mathring{A}=A-\partial{A}$.
