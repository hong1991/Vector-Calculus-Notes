1. The **type 1 elementary matrix** $E_1(i,x)$ is the square [[matrix]] where all non-diagonal entries are $0$, and every entry on the diagonal is $1$ except for the $(i, i)$th entry, which is $x\ne0$.
2. The **type 2 elementary matrix** $E_2(i,j,x)$, for $i\ne j$, is the square matrix with all diagonal entries $1$, and all other entries $0$ except for the $(i,j)$th, which is $x$. Remember that the first index, $i$, refers to the row, and the second, $j$, refers to the column.
3. The **type 3 elementary matrix** $E_3(i,j)$, $i\ne j$, is the square matrix where the entries $i,j$ and $j,i$ are 1, as are all entries on the diagonal except $i,i$ and $j,j$ which are $0$. All others are $0$.

**Propositions**
1. $(E_1(i,x))^{-1}=E_1(i,1/x)$
2. $(E_2(i,j,x))^{-1}=E_2(i,j,-x)$
3. $(E_3(i,j))^{-1}=E_3(i,j)$.
