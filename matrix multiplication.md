If $A$ is an $m\times n$ [[matrix]] whose $(i,j)$th entry is $a_{i,j}$, and $B$ is an $n\times p$ matrix whose $(i,j)$th entry is $b_{i,j}$, then $C=AB$ is the $m\times p$ matrix with entries $$c_{i,j}=\sum_{k=1}^na_{i,k}b_{k,j}.$$

**Proposition:** Matrix multiplication is associative $$(AB)C=A(BC).$$
